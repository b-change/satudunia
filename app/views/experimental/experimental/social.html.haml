						1. Purpose
					#lipsum.tags-list-about
						%p
							The aim of BE is to support the well-being of young people who are exploring their sexual orientation and gender identity. The service will provide information about the diverse lives of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, as well as people who are simply curious about other sexual orientations and/or gender identities.
						%p
							BE operates under a Policy of Inclusion where people of different sexual orientations, gender identities, ages, ethnicity, socio-economic status and religions are welcome to join the discussion once they become registered members. Upon registration, it is assumed that all users acknowledge that BE is primarily a space for the empowerment of young people who are exploring their sexual orientation and gender identity including, but not limited to, people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender or curious.
